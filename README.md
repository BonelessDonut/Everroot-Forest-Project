## Project status
As of June 1, development has been halted due to a lack of time. Please feel free to create a fork of this project and continue it.


## Name
Everroot Forest

## Description
Our idea is an exciting dungeon crawler game where you fight enemies and collect flowers and ores to give to the spirits of nature. Travel throughout the different rooms using different combinations of melee and ranged weapons. Talk to different NPCs to collect new ites, upgrade them, and buy different consumable items. Finally, defeat the boss to bring peace back to the world. This game is meant to be reminiscent of games such as Legend of Zelda and Hades.
    ## Features:
    - Explore a dungeon
    - Fight various different enemies
    - Collect flowers and ores to save the spirits of nature
    - Talk to some of the few, surviving nature spirits
    - Upgrade your weapons and buy items to fight
    - Defeat the boss

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Requirements
- Pygame (https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
- Pathfinding (https://pypi.org/project/pathfinding/)
- Some IDE

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
