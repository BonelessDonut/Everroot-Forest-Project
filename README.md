## Project status
As of June 1, development has been halted due to a lack of time. Please feel free to create a fork of this project and continue it.


## Name
Everroot Forest

## Description
Our idea is an exciting dungeon crawler game where you fight enemies and collect flowers and ores to give to the spirits of nature. Travel throughout the different rooms using different combinations of melee and ranged weapons. Talk to different NPCs to collect new ites, upgrade them, and buy different consumable items. Finally, defeat the boss to bring peace back to the world. This game is meant to be reminiscent of games such as Legend of Zelda and Hades.

  Features:

  - Explore a dungeon

  - Fight various different enemies

  - Collect flowers and ores to save the spirits of nature

  - Talk to some of the few, surviving nature spirits

  - Upgrade your weapons and buy items to fight
  
  - Defeat the boss

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Requirements
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pygame (https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
- Pathfinding (https://pypi.org/project/pathfinding/)
- Some IDE like Pycharm, Visual Studio Code

## Installation
After having Python installed along with some IDE to run Python, install both of the dependencies (Pygame and Pathfinding). If you have python installed, you can try
'pip install pygame' and
'pip install pathfinding'
to download the modules. Otherwise, find out how to download other modules using your IDE and download them. After having done so, open the main.py file and run it.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, make sure to properly install the game.
