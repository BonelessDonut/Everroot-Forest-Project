Charlenne Tan notes on Procedural Generation

general information on procedural generation that may be useful for our game:
- one room can generate into automatically generated different kinds of rooms without the coder coding an entire map
- procedural content can "adapt" to different screen sizes and resolutions
- allows the player to replay an entire game as if it were new with differently generated maps
- new tasks to discuss/think about
 - generating rooms of different sizes and shapes
 - making the map loop on itself so that the player has better innate navigation and doesn't get lost
 - giving rooms differing or specific content
looked up procedural generation done in 3d from a new coder's POV and looked for inspiration here on what to look up for the rooms
- spawning things only at specific locations (ie reeds only at a formed beach that's by a lake)
- spawning chance creating different odds for certain things spawning at certain locations (ie mushrooms at the base of a tree)
- having new content generated not spawn within each other (ie vegetation in a rock)
- having a main path that the user can follow instead of wandering aimlessly

<<<<<<< HEAD
for randomizing enemies, walls, flowers..
pre-make the inside walls of differing rooms
set rooms into a class
randomize which rooms 
- loop to check if there is a wall
- - if yes, randomize again to place enemies and flowers (flowers static, enemies moving)
=======
for randomizing enemies, walls, flowers...
pre-make the inside walls of differing rooms (purple rooms would have a premade list of possible rooms with walls and enemy number combinations that get randomized between purple rooms, same with others colors)
set colored rooms into a class?
randomize which room of internal walls go to each respective color (most important for purple and green rooms)
to place flowers:
- loop to check if there is a wall or enemy
- - if yes, randomize again to place flowers until there are a certain number of flowers in the room
- - if not, place the flower in that tile
